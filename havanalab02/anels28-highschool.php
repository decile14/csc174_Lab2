	<p>I then went full speed ahead and pursued theatre. I did not concern myself with going to stressful tryouts or the grueling conditioning practices. The way I played sports, there was always a ranking and everyone was always fighting to get to the top. It was exhausting. With theatre, I did not feel this pressure and felt more joy regardless of the size of the role I got. With my new found passion, I started doing more plays and musicals. I met some amazing people, and the course of my life changed. It all came full circle my senior year when I got the role of Ariel in our production of “The Little Mermaid.” It was an extremely rewarding process, and I would go back to that moment in a heartbeat.</p>
