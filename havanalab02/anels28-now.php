		<p>As a junior in college, I have been a part of each show ROC Players has done in the past two years. I was an angry stepsister in “Into the Woods,” a tyrannical parent in “Spring Awakening,” and a comedic dancer during the Nazi era in “Cabaret.” I became a Stage Manager, something I never thought I would be able to do in theatre. I always saw myself on the stage, so it was incredible to finally go behind the scenes to see how the magic happens. In addition, I was elected to be the Artistic Director of the group in the most recent elections. This group has given me so much, and I can’t wait to return the favor and give it back to them in my junior year. Trying something new and unexpected can be scary, but it has completely given me a new perspective on my life and goals. </p>
