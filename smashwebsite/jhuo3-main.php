	<p>As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester, I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science. Due to computer science and codingâ€™s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020 in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities. Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates. </p>
